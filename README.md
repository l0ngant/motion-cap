# Motion_cap

This is a small project that I coded following an online Python course.
It's a bit raw and most certainly improvable, but it was pretty satisfying to see it working!

## Usage

Start the, well, 'start.py' script. A webcam has to be installed and turned on, otherwise you will get an error.
The script keeps running until 'q' is pressed on the keyboard.
After ending, it will save the timestamps of the motions captured by the cam, and generate a graph with those data.
Enjoy!
